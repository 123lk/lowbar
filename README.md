# Lowbar
The Lowbar Sprint involved reimplementing some of the functions from the JS library [underscore](http://underscorejs.org/) to help us appreciate what's going on behind the scenes when we make use of it's functionality.  The sprint was completed practicing the principles of test-driven development.
